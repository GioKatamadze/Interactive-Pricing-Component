## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout, page responsiveness and pricing functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Input view count

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background image
3. Create wrapper div
4. Add icons and text
5. Give icon sizes and styles in Tailwind CSS
6. Create hover effects for buttons
7. Add slider
8. Add views result section
9. Add pricing result section
10. Add Javascript code to make functional pricing app

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Media Queries
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Tailwind CSS, the main challenge that I overcame was to create Js Functionality for the APP. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the HTML code usng Tailwind, that gave website the same design result as it was shown in figma design. Js code calculates pricing for particular view amount and if payment is annual, calculates price with 25% discount.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
